Fare Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Overview

This project implements a fare price prediction model using Linear Regression. The model predicts the fare price of rides based on various input features such as distance, time, passenger count, and other relevant factors.

Features

Uses Linear Regression for fare prediction

Handles data preprocessing including missing values and outliers

Performs feature engineering to improve model accuracy

Evaluates the model using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared

Provides visualization of data trends
